# cls-command-for-Linux
If you prefer good old Windows CMD commands, like me, and hate typing "clear" in the Linux terminal, this thing for you. (Fyi it's super basic)

# How it works?
It is just a shell script that just has 'clear', the file 'chmod +x', renamed not to have the '.sh' at the end and moved to 'bin' directory.

# Why is this a thing?
Don't question, I am weird.
